There's nothing more discomforting than not knowing your location. We have all experienced it.  It's the panic that overtakes you when you don't recognize your surroundings.  The buildings and roads are unfamiliar.  You don't know where you are.  Naturally, you focus on getting to a familiar landmark or location.  Reaching that landmark brings a sense of relief.   Comfort.  Peace.  Because you know where you are on a map, it's easier to plot a course to your final destination.  



Ansecombe's quartet is a perfect example where spatial awareness adds a new dimension of understanding.
