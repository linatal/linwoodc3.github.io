## Linwood's Introduction and Motivation

Motivation is hard to measure.   

It's one of those intangible skills that everyone wants in a friend, coworker, or subordinate. This page is your window into the topics and personal projects that motivate me every single day.  Welcome to my journey to become an expert in data science.   I am fueled by an unending motivation to work in the field I love.

Google and YouTube are my instructors.  Python and R are my preferred tools, where Python is my strongest language. Time is my only limitation.
