## Linwood's Introduction and Motivation

Motivation is hard to measure.   It's one of those intangible skills that everyone wants in a friend, coworker, or subordinate, but is also hard to find.  This page is a window into the topics and personal projects that motivate me every single day.  This journey to become an expert in data science is fueled by my unending motivation to work in the field I love. 

Google and YouTube are my instructors.  Python and R are my preferred languages, where Python is my strongest language.  If I had to pick a specialty, it would be data analysis, data cleaning, and communication.  Quite often, a good project or product fails to materialize because the impact or outcome is not clearly communicated to decision makers.  My goal is to make the message clear and accurate.  

This page will provide  a few examples.
