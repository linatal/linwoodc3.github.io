I also introduce my Python client to access and process GDELT data in the Python ecosystem.  This is especially useful if you have business interests in areas with stability issues.

       "GDELT is a service that monitors print, broadcast, and web news media in over 100 languages from nearly all countries in the world. Enabled by this constant stream of news data,  GDELT can monitor breaking news events anywhere on the planet.  While it's outside the scope of this introductory post, GDELT data can identify the news providers who have a history of generating original content earliest for breaking issues in certain parts of the world.  Conversely, GDELT data can also find news providers who specialize in redisseminating another provider's content, exposing it to wider audiences at the cost of speed.  And finally, GDELT data prepositions data to build timelines of events by combining information across news sources ordered by time as we will demonstrate in this post.  \n",
       "\n",
       "## GDELT's Coding System: CAMEO Codes\n",
       "The CAMEO code is the center of GDELT data analysis.  CAMEO which stands for [Conflict and Mediation Event Observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_and_Mediation_Event_Observations), is a framework for coding event data to support the study of political and violent events.  Each GDELT record or news story has a CAMEO code that provides a pivot point to filter and categorize news content.  Combing CAMEO code filtering with GDELT's geoinferecing service, it is a simple task to build pipelines that monitor news at the city level (or province/state or country or continent) on certain topics across the globe in an automated fashion.  The [coding system is pretty extensive](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf).  For example, to track all news on mass killings in Kigali, Rwanda, we only need to filter on CAMEO code '202' and the [geonames feature identifier for Kigali,  '-2181358' ](http://www.geonames.org/) .  \n",
       "\n",
       "For all of GDELT's strengths, it would be intellectually dishonest for me to ignore the reported weaknesses.  To what others have identified as strengths and weaknesses, see [M.D. Ward et al's **Comparing GDELT and ICEWS Event Data**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303211430_Comparing_GDELT_and_ICEWS_event_data).  \n",

       "That closes out our brief introduction to gdeltPyR and our story. To summarize, we pulled a chronologically ordered list of URLs to news stories on the Marawi crisis.  After we pulled the data from GDELT, we used the geonames featureid and the CAMEO code to filter down to the relevant data; this can be repeated for any issue or location.  To build the final timeline, you only need to read the stories and write coherently to make your timeline.      \n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "For `gdeltPyR` (which I hope you will use or help me develop!), I focused on abstracting the details API calls away from the user. For those who run into feature ID problems, there's an easy way to build your own lookup table of feature ids.  Just pull a few days of GDELT data using gdeltPyR, isolate unique feature ids, and create a second column that holds the different names tied to the same feature id.  Pretty soon, you'll have the id and name for most cities, provinces/states, and countries.\n",

       "I need to give you a warning on data consumption; GDELT is MASSIVE.  I will connect gdeltPyR directly into the free Google BigQuery into GDELT data, but here is a fair warning. If you do a query with gdeltPyR covering more than a few months, you'd need to have more than 16 GBs of RAM or you can create a pipeline that reads the data in, writes to disc, and flushes RAM before going to the next day.  \n",

       "- Extend analytic above by adding news provider and time component to find news providers who provide most original content faster\n",
       "- Do everything above, but try to use the resulting corpus for text summarization\n",
       "- New organizations could use this data to ensure they are adding original content when they publish!\n",

       "The Walkoff:  Every post needs a graphic.  Below, you'll see a simple time series graphic that charts the magnitude of our target CAMEO code and feature id (normalized by total hour count) through time. We see an obvious uptick in activity later in the day, led by a complete lack of activity. Welcome your thoughts on whether this is statistically relevant. Since we have a geoname entry for nearly every city on the planet, we can run this analytic ad finitum on each CAMEO code and each feature id; the only limitations are compute power and storage. \n",
