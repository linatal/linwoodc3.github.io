    "excerpt: \"In the world of data science, we embrace the concept of spatial awareness and knowing where the data are (or datum is). In the same way that geospatial grounding (i.e. georeferenced data) brings clarity to a lost traveler, spatial context can bring clarity to a data set.  Moreover, this “where” does not always have to apply to a location on the earth’s surface . Spatial context (i.e. analytic geometry), or understanding data in the context of geometric space, is just as enlightening.\"\n",

      "LANAO DEL SUR, Philippines - Gunshots reverberated through villages in Barangay Basak Malulut in Marawi City as Maute gunmen and soldiers clashed there Tuesday, sending Maranaws running for their lives. Senior Superintendent Oscar Nantes, director of the Lanao del Sur provincial police, said the scene of the encounter is not too distant from their headquarters and the campus of the Mindanao State University. “We can hear automatic gunshots from where we are,” Nantes told The STAR at exactly 3:20 p.m. Tuesday. Local officials told The STAR loud explosions rocked the barangay as members of the Maute terror group and soldiers traded shots. The Maute group is also known as the Dawlah Islamiya Philippines, which espouses hatred to non-Muslims. It also boasts of loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and uses the black ISIS flag as its revolutionary banner. Nantes said personnel of Army units under the 103rd Brigade based in Marawi City were to search for members of the Maute group in Barangay Basak Malulut when the encounter erupted. The group, founded by radical siblings Abdullah and Omar Maute, lost more than 50 members in a spate of encounters with soldiers in the past five months. “We are still investigating on what caused the encounter this afternoon,” Nantes said. Army intelligence sources said members of the Maute group had infiltrated a gathering of hundreds of Tablighs in the barangay, prompting the deployment there of soldiers backed by armoured vehicles. The Tablighs are missionaries engage in da’awah (preaching) activities that many moderate Islamic theologians do not agree with. Among the staunch critics of the Tablighs was the late Imam Salamat Hashim, founder of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, who had studied Islamic theology at the Al-Azzhar University in Cairo, Egypt. Zia Alonto Adiong, a member of the 24-seat Regional Assembly in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, said he received reports purporting that the raging gunfights in Barangay Basak Malulut involved local ISIS-styled extremists and soldiers. Adiong, who resides in Marawi City, has urged his constituents to stay in their homes to ensure their safety through text messages to community elders and via an appeal he posted on his Facebook timeline.

      " Philippines security forces continue to battle the Abu Sayyaf group, which has kidnapped hundreds since the early 1990s to extract ransoms Philippine troops and police battled dozens of gunmen protecting one of the world's most wanted Islamic militants in a built-up area of a southern city on Tuesday, authorities said. At least one policeman was killed in the hunt for Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the infamous Abu Sayyaf kidnap gang and Philippine head of the Islamic State group, according to Philippine military chief of staff General Eduardo Ano. The fighting took place in Marawi, a mostly Muslim-populated city of about 200,000 people on the southern island of Mindanao, with the gunmen attacking a hospital during the clashes, Ano told CNN Philippines. \"Please advise people to stay inside their houses. We will clear the area,\" Ano said. He said the fighting began when police and troops raided a house on Tuesday afternoon where Hapilon, the subject of a US State Department bounty of $5 million, was believed to be hiding. This triggered fierce clashes throughout the afternoon and into the evening, with Ano estimating there were about 50 gunmen. Photos posted on social media by Marawi residents showed the gunmen walking through the streets of Basak, a Marawi suburb of about 1,700 people. A woman who asked not to be named told AFP by text that she saw about 10 armed men take up positions at the gate of a government hospital. Police clashed with the gunmen near the hospital, leaving one officer seriously wounded and one of the extremists dead, she added. The military said it could not confirm the militant's death. Ano said eight security personnel had been injured in the clashes. - Deadly history - The Abu Sayyaf, based on the most southern islands of Mindanao, has kidnapped hundreds of Filipinos and foreigners since the early 1990s to extract ransoms. The militants beheaded an elderly German early this year and two Canadians last year after ransom demands were not met. It has also been blamed for the country's worst terrorist attacks, including the 2004 bombing of a ferry in Manila Bay that claimed more than 100 lives. The US State Department bounty for Hapilon was offered following alleged terrorist acts against US citizens, including the 2001 kidnapping of three Americans in the western Philippines -- two of whom were later killed. Security analysts say Hapilon has been trying to unite Filipino militant groups that have professed allegiance to IS. These include the Maute group, which is based near Marawi, hundreds of kilometres to the north of the Abu Sayyaf strongholds. The Maute group has engaged in repeated deadly battles with the military over the past year in rural areas around Marawi. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has an office near Marawi and operates in the area, voiced alarm that civilians may get caught up in the fighting. \"We are extremely concerned about the impact of the ongoing hostilities in Marawi City on the civilians,\" the head of the ICRC's Philippine delegation, Pascal Porchet, said in a statement. \"We urge all parties to the conflict to spare civilians and respect civilian property, such as hospitals and schools, in fulfullment of their obligations to respect international humanitarian law.\" The Marawi fighting came six weeks after the military foiled a mass kidnapping attempt by the Abu Sayyaf on the central resort island of Bohol. The US and other Western governments warned this month that terrorists plan to kidnap foreigners in tourist hotspots across the central and western Philippines.

      "Martin Petty and Manuel Mogato 4 Min Read MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte cut short a visit to Russia and imposed martial law on the island of Mindanao on Tuesday after a fierce bout of fighting erupted during a raid by security forces at a hideout of Islamic State-linked militants.  Two soldiers and a policeman were killed and 12 wounded amid chaos in Marawi, a predominantly Muslim city of about 200,000 people, where members of the Maute militant group took control of buildings and set fire to a school, a church and a detention facility.  Duterte, a native of Mindanao, canceled a meeting set for Wednesday with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Tass news agency said President Vladimir Putin would see him before his departure Tuesday night, instead of on Thursday as planned.   \"The government is in full control of the situation and is fully aware that the Maute/ISIS and similar groups have the capability, though limited, to disturb the peace,\" presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella told a news conference in Moscow.  The Maute and Abu Sayyaf militant groups have pledged allegiance to Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and have proved  fierce opponents for the military as Duterte seeks to crush extremists and prevent radical Islamist ideology from spreading in the Philippines.  Abella said the militants \"have shown no hesitation in causing havoc, taking innocent lives and destroying property.\"  Duterte has warned repeatedly that Mindanao, an impoverished, restive region the size of South Korea, was at risk of \"contamination\" by Islamic State fighters driven out of Iraq and Syria.  Brigadier General Rolando Bautista, commander of the Philippines' First Infantry Division, said security forces were trying to locate militants who had scattered everywhere and were blocking reinforcements from arriving.  \"There are more or less 100, divided into groups of 10 in different locations,\" Bautista told news channel ANC.  \"Since they are advocating ISIS ideology they have to show ISIS that they are a force to be reckoned with.\"  Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said and some 1,000 soldiers would be in Marawi by morning, but warned civilians to stay in their homes.  \"There are Maute snipers all around, so the troops are still holding and elements have already joined,\" he said.  The purpose of Tuesday's raid was to capture Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the Abu Sayyaf group which is notorious for piracy and for kidnapping and beheading Westerners. The U.S. State Department has offered a bounty of up to $5 million for Hapilon's arrest.  The military has not explained how the raid on an apartment turned into urban warfare that was still raging 12 hours later.  The incident highlights the challenges facing Duterte, who has pleaded with separatists and moderate Muslims in the predominantly Catholic nation to shun Abu Sayyaf and Maute.   He has threatened several times to declare martial law in Mindanano, and deliver a \"harsh\" crackdown. Martial law will apply for 60 days.  The government has blamed the Maute for a bombing in September 2016 at a street market in Duterte's hometown of Davao City, which killed 14 people and wounded dozens.  Maute fighters took over a disused building in the region in November and endured five days of military air and ground assaults before fleeing, with 61 fighters killed.

      "  Security analysts say Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the infamous Abu Sayyaf kidnapping-for-ransom gang, has been trying to unite militant groups that have professed allegiance to IS.  MANILA: Philippine security forces hunting one of the world’s most-wanted Islamist militants were battling gunmen in a southern city on Tuesday, authorities said. Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the infamous Abu Sayyaf kidnapping-for-ransom gang who the Islamic State group has appointed its Philippine chief, was believed to be among those fighting police and soldiers in Marawi city, regional military spokeswoman Captain Jo-Ann Petinglay told AFP. “Right now we are conducting a surgical operation,” Lieutenant-Colonel Jo-ar Herrera, spokesman for the army division involved in the fighting, told AFP by phone. Herrera said five security personnel had been injured, although he did not know if there were any casualties among the estimated 15 gunmen. Herrera and other military officials said Hapilon was the target of the operation, which took place in the residential area of Basak, a suburb of about 1,700 people in the mainly Muslim southern city of Marawi. The Abu Sayyaf, based in the southern region of Mindanao, has kidnapped hundreds of Filipinos and foreigners since the early 1990s to extract ransoms. The militants beheaded an elderly German and two Canadians last year after ransom demands were not met. It has also been blamed for the country’s worst terrorist attacks, including the 2004 bombing of a ferry in Manila Bay that claimed more than 100 lives. The US State Department has a put up a $5-million bounty on Hapilon’s head for alleged terrorist acts against US citizens, including the 2001 kidnapping of three Americans in the western Philippines, two of whom were later killed. Security analysts say Hapilon has been trying to unite militant groups that have professed allegiance to IS. These include the Maute group, which is based near Marawi in central Mindanao. The Maute group has been the subject of military operations in the past year in rural areas around Marawi, a city of about 200,000 residents that is located 800 kilometres (500 miles) south of the Philippine capital Manila. “Our objective is to neutralise Hapilon, who is reported to be in the area, and the Maute core group,” Petinglay told AFP, adding the operation began at 2:00 pm (0600 GMT) and was continuing. “These are all high-value targets, so you can say this is a major operation,” she said, adding the estimated 15 suspects were armed with high-powered rifles. An army brigade comprising at least a thousand troops were involved in the operation, she said. Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

      "Fresh clashes erupted Tuesday afternoon between government troops and joint forces of the Maute Group and Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), under Isnilon Hapilon, in Marawi City, the military said. Map of Marawi City.Wikipedia | mb.com.ph Map of Marawi City.Wikipedia | mb.com.ph Lt. Col. Jo-Ar Herrera, the spokesman of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division (1ID), said the gun battle erupted at 2 p.m. in Barangay Basak, Malulut, Marawi. Residents reportedly identified the gunmen as core group members of the Maute Group, said Herrera. He added that ASG leader Hapilon was seen with the group. Hapilon was earlier reported wounded seriously in the airstrikes in Butig, Lanao del Sur, last January. “Initially, what they (residents) saw were 15 members of the armed group. Allegedly Isnilon Hapilon is also there. So our operation is centered on a high-value target,” said Herrera, adding that the military has launched operations to neutralize the group. However, he said that they have yet to get details on their men on the ground if the enemy sustained any casualties, stressing that the firefight was on-going as of press time. Latest reports from the ground said five troopers have been wounded. They are undergoing treatment. Herrera said has yet to receive verification that members of the Maute Group had raised an ISIS flag at the Amai Pakpak Medical Center during the attack. “We have not received any report regarding that,” he said. Meanwhile, AFP spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said that contrary to various reports circulating, the AFP and Philippine National Police (PNP) initiated this operation in Marawi. “We received reliable information on Hapilon and a number of his cohorts.

      " Photos uploaded on ISIS Live Map show Maute jihadists during the May 23, 2017 Marawi City siege. (Mindanao Examiner)   MARAWI CITY – Members of the jihadist Maute group have occupied several areas in Marawi City in the restive province of Lanao del Sur sparking sporadic clashes with army soldiers. The jihadists hoisted ISIS flags at a hospital and several establishments here and even used a police car with the Daesh flag to block a road. Several civilians and soldiers, including a policeman, were reported wounded or killed in the fighting, but local security officials did not release a statement on the clashes. The 103rd Infantry Brigade also did not issue any statement or reports over the daring attacks by the Maute fighters, whose group has pledged allegiance to the ISIS, and vowed to establish a caliphate in the troubled region. But by evening, the Western Mindanao Command military headquarters in Zamboanga City said troops clashed with about 15 gunmen in the village of Basak. It said the fighting erupted after Maute members attacked security forces sent to the area following intelligence reports that gunmen were hiding in the village. However, locals said there were dozens of Maute members scattered in the villages. A building was also set on fire and electricity cut off and making it extremely difficult for security forces to pursue the militants here.  And the local mayor Majul Gandamra, who is holed out with his security personnel at the City Hall building, said there were no soldiers and policemen in areas where the militants were. He said he asked the military and police for assistance to help protect City Hall, but no soldiers arrived.  Army Captain Jo-ann Petinglay, a spokeswoman for the Western Mindanao Command, said sympathizers of the Maute group also attacked soldiers triggering a gun battle. “Government forces were able to contain majority of the militants in one area however, some of their sympathizers conducted diversionary tactics in other locations to divide the attention of the reinforcing military personnel,” she said, adding, by dusk, operations against the armed group were continuing. “Operations are still ongoing and other details cannot yet be revealed so as not to compromise operational security,” Petinglay said, who also urged locals to refrain from uploading photos or video clip of soldiers pursuing the militants. “We urge all peace loving people to refrain from posting in social media information that would tend to exacerbate the situation. Especially photos and videos on the movements of our troops and on terrorist propaganda circulating through social media,” she said. Regional Governor Mujiv Hataman has condemned “these acts of terror” and said the government stands in solidarity with Marawi “in thee dark times.”  Words might seem useless right now, as no words can express what we feel as we share in the fear and anger of our people. We strongly condemn these acts of terror committed against the people of Marawi City and swear to take immediate action as necessary. Marawi City is known as the Philippines’ Islamic City, but it is home to people of different histories, different beliefs. That these acts of terror are happening in a diverse community bound by mutual respect and a shared commitment to peace is a travesty.” “Any group who sows terror and then dares to say that they do it in the name of Islam should be ashamed. Any man who claims to fight for a just cause, yet dares to incite violence a few days before the Holy Month of Ramadhan is a monster whose words belie his actions. The regional government stands in solidarity with the city of Marawi in these dark times. We have won many struggles together and we will stop at nothing to bring these terrorists to justice and win back the peace in your beloved city and in the Bangsamoro,” Hataman said. Abu Sayyaf chieftain Isnilon Hapilon, who is also the titular head of the local ISIS group, was spotted along with a group of jihadists. Hapilon was first reported by the military to have been either killed or wounded in clashes last year with security forces in nearby Butig town. This was not the first time jihadists had launch attacks against security forces right in the heart of Marawi. There had been previous Maute offensives that military and police failed to prevent. The siege lasted for several hours. Photos and video clip of the siege were also posted by locals on their social media account and ISIS Live Map also uploaded pictures on the Internet showing heavily-armed jihadists clad in black robe walking the streets of Marawi. One of them even spoke on a bullhorn as he walked the street while locals listen nervously. No one dared to stop the jihadist. (Mindanao Examiner.

      "Share Manila (AFP) - Philippine troops and police battled dozens of gunmen protecting one of the world's most wanted Islamic militants in a built-up area of a southern city on Tuesday, authorities said. At least one policeman was killed in the hunt for Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the infamous Abu Sayyaf kidnap gang and Philippine head of the Islamic State group, according to Philippine military chief of staff General Eduardo Ano. The fighting took place in Marawi, a mostly Muslim-populated city of about 200,000 people on the southern island of Mindanao, with the gunmen attacking a hospital during the clashes, Ano told CNN Philippines. \"Please advise people to stay inside their houses. We will clear the area,\" Ano said. He said the fighting began when police and troops raided a house on Tuesday afternoon where Hapilon, the subject of a US State Department bounty of $5 million, was believed to be hiding. This triggered fierce clashes throughout the afternoon and into the evening, with Ano estimating there were about 50 gunmen. Photos posted on social media by Marawi residents showed the gunmen walking through the streets of Basak, a Marawi suburb of about 1,700 people. A woman who asked not to be named told AFP by text that she saw about 10 armed men take up positions at the gate of a government hospital. Police clashed with the gunmen near the hospital, leaving one officer seriously wounded and one of the extremists dead, she added. The military said it could not confirm the militant's death. Ano said eight security personnel had been injured in the clashes. - Deadly history - The Abu Sayyaf, based on the most southern islands of Mindanao, has kidnapped hundreds of Filipinos and foreigners since the early 1990s to extract ransoms. The militants beheaded an elderly German early this year and two Canadians last year after ransom demands were not met. It has also been blamed for the country's worst terrorist attacks, including the 2004 bombing of a ferry in Manila Bay that claimed more than 100 lives. The US State Department bounty for Hapilon was offered following alleged terrorist acts against US citizens, including the 2001 kidnapping of three Americans in the western Philippines -- two of whom were later killed. Security analysts say Hapilon has been trying to unite Filipino militant groups that have professed allegiance to IS. These include the Maute group, which is based near Marawi, hundreds of kilometres to the north of the Abu Sayyaf strongholds. The Maute group has engaged in repeated deadly battles with the military over the past year in rural areas around Marawi. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has an office near Marawi and operates in the area, voiced alarm that civilians may get caught up in the fighting. \"We are extremely concerned about the impact of the ongoing hostilities in Marawi City on the civilians,\" the head of the ICRC's Philippine delegation, Pascal Porchet, said in a statement. \"We urge all parties to the conflict to spare civilians and respect civilian property, such as hospitals and schools, in fulfullment of their obligations to respect international humanitarian law.\" The Marawi fighting came six weeks after the military foiled a mass kidnapping attempt by the Abu Sayyaf on the central resort island of Bohol. The US and other Western governments warned this month that terrorists plan to kidnap foreigners in tourist hotspots across the central and western Philippines.

      " Updated 23:06 PM PHT Tue, May 23, 2017 (CNN Philippines, May 23) — Government forces clashed with members of the rebel group Maute in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur on Tuesday. Reports said armed men have taken over the Amai Pakpak Medical Center, with the group allegedly replacing the Philippine flag with a black flag, supposedly representing the Islamic State (ISIS). They have also reportedly blocked checkpoints in the vicinity. Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) First Infantry Division Spokesman Lt. Col. Jo-Ar Herrera said the firefight started 2 p.m. at Barangay Basak Malutlut. \"Nakatangap po tayo ng report from the community, meron silang nakitang mga armado...na-check po natin na ito pala yung ano, yung core group ng Maute, so nag-launch po tayo ng surgical operation para i-neutralize 'yung grupo na may planong mag-ano ng terorismo sa Marawi City,\" Herrera said. [Translation: We received a report from the community, they saw armed men…we checked that this is the core group of Maute, so we launched a surgical operation to neutralize the group planning to incite terrorism in Marawi City.] He added Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon was among the 15 armed men seen in the area. Herrera said while firefight has ended, clearing operations are still ongoing, as at least five members of the government force sustained injuries. Redoble Adonis of Camp Ranao said a group inspired by ISIS attacked the 103rd Brigade, situated at Camp Ranao in Marawi City. \"The AFP members directly blocked their way resulting to exchange of fire. Accordingly, not less than 500 members of Maute (Isis) tried to penetrate the camp. GT Marawi situated at Campo Ranaw, Marawi City is about 300 meters from the place of the attacked,\" Adonis said. However, AFP spokesman Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said a combined military and police force initiated the operation in Marawi. \"We received reliable info on Hapilon and a number of his cohorts. Updates to follow as the operation is still ongoing,\" Padilla said. Marawi City Mayor Majul Gandamra told CNN Philippines' News Night the hospital under siege is just about 2 km away from the city hall. \"Right now, based on initial information, no casualties reported...we are coordinating with the military, wala po silang casulaties na sinabi,\" Gandamra said. There are eyewitness reports that the Marawi City Jail and the Dansalan Junior College were on fire. \n",

      "MARAWI. Armored personnel carrier are deployed by the Philippine Army in a firefight in barangay Caloocan, Marawi City, Tuesday, May 23. (Photo courtesy of AFP) (UPDATED) -- Two soldiers and one policeman were reported killed, while 12 others were injured, during a firefight between government forces and members of the Maute terror group on Tuesday afternoon, May 23, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said. Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesperson Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said that the ongoing clash in Marawi City, Lanao Del Sur is aimed at neutralizing Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was spotted along with an estimated 15 followers in the area. \"The military operation focus on the alleged presence of Isnilon Hapilon with the 15 fully armed Maute group who occupied an apartment as their rendezvous in Marawi City,\" Philippine Army 1st Infantry Tank Division spokesperson Colonel Jo-ar Herera said. READ: Duterte declares martial law in Mindanao Hapilon is reportedly the representative of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis) terror group in the Philippines.  Lorenzana also confirmed that Maute bandits began occupying some establishments in the city like Amai Pakpak Medical Center, the City Hall, and the city jail. He also verified that the church, city jail, Ninoy Aquino School and Dansalan College have been set on fire by the group. “As of tonight (Tuesday, May 23), the Maute group burned several facilities – the church, city jail, the Ninoy Aquino School and the Dansalan College. The Maute fighters still occupy also the main street of Marawi city called the Quezon Street and two bridges,” Lorenzana said. Senior Superintendent Oscar Nantes, Lanao del Sur police provincial director, said the fighting erupted when the Maute group opened fire on personnel from the military’s 103rd Brigade. \"When the firefight ensued, there were reported re-enforcement from the symphatizers of Maute where pocket firefight erupted in nearby areas,\" Hererra said. READ: AFP: Operations, firefight in Marawi City continues Police said the fighting erupted around 3 p.m. in the villages of Caloocan and Basak Malutlut, near the Lanao del Sur police provincial command and Mindanao State University. The fighting reportedly sent thousands of residents fleeing while others were locked inside their homes. It happened about two days before the start of the fasting month of Ramadhan. Chief Superintendent Reuben Sindac, Philippine National Police-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Armm) regional director based, said all police units across Lanao del Sur have been placed on heightened alert against the possible spillover of the fighting. Armored personnel carriers backed the ground troops in fighting the Maute Group members, Nantes said. READ: Oro under full alert after Marawi City clash As of 4 p.m., Tuesday, two Air Force planes dropped several bombs in selected areas of Marawi City, particularly in the border with Lanao del Sur beside Lake Lanao. Gunshots could still be heard in the heart of Marawi City, according to Zia Alonto Adiong, an Armm lawmaker and a resident of Marawi City. He appealed for residents to stay home. In the nearby City of Iligan, the police said all entry and exit points in the city are now locked down. Full alert status are being raised. The clashes erupted while Muslims are preparing to start the fasting month, which is expected to begin this Friday with the possible sighting of the moon on Thursday night, May 25. On November 28, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte revealed the link between the Maute group to Isis after the encounter between the military and the Maute group in Lanao del Sur. READ: Duterte: Isis now connected with Maute group The clash occurred on November 26, 2016 in Butig town, Lanao del Sur where the Maute group occupied and raised the black flag of the Isis at the abandoned municipal hall of the town. At least 20 soldiers were wounded and some 35 Maute group members were killed in the clash. (SunStar Philippines/PNA/With Ruth Abbey Gita/And Richel V.

      "COTABATO CITY (MindaNews/23 May) — Suspected members of the Maute group ambushed Tuesday troops from the 1st Infantry Division and policemen in downtown Marawi City and took control of parts of the area causing panic among residents. Retired colonel Tatar Boriongan, Lanao Del Sur Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office chief said the clash erupted around 2pm at the lower portion of the Mindanao State University Compound in Marawi City’s Basak Malulut village. “Civilians now are in panic, there is tension in many corners of the downtown area, so we advised the public to stay in their houses as situation is still unpredictable,” Boriongan said. He said even their team could not get out of the office due to reports that the Maute group had put up checkpoints. He added they were still trying to ascertain if there had been civilian casualties. Lt. Col. Joar Herrera, spokesperson of the 1st Infantry Division said they conducted law enforcement operation on Tuesday afternoon together with police forces in the province in response to reports that suspected terrorists led by Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon were conducting community organizing among residents. But upon reaching Basak Malulut gunfire greeted the government forces forcing them to fire back, Herrera said. As of Tuesday afternoon there were no reports of casualties on either side. The armed group has reportedly taken control of Barangays Saber, Sarimanok, Mapandi, Amai Pakpak, the area near the provincial jail, Malutlut, and Calookan. Resident Norhanidah Macatoon posted on Facebook photos seemingly grabbed from a CCTV footage in her house, of armed men with high-powered firearms wearing camouflage parading near Masjid Abubakar Markaz where the heavy clash took place. “Allahu Akbar! Brothers and Sisters please stay in your houses,” she said. A flag of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was hoisted inside Amai Pakpak Hospital, which is near the city hall and the Army’s brigade station, a report confirmed by the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Humanitarian Emergency Action Response Team (ARMM-HEART). “It caused panic (among) civilians inside the hospital but none of them was used as shields by the armed group. They only raised the black flag there,” said Abul Alibasa, a resident of Marawi city who is monitoring the developments. “There is also violence happening near Haifah Palace of Calookan of Marawi city,” Alibasa said. “All of the physicians and nurses on duty there are safe and okay per our communication. Employees are in hiding. May mga sundalo na daw duon sa may (There are soldiers at the) gate. Sana manegotiate nila (I hope they can negotiate) peacefully. Please spare the hapless patients at the hospital,” said Omai Atar, wife of Marawi’s sultan and an employee of Amai Pakpak hospital. She said it would appear that the attacks in various parts of the city were simultaneously done. “I heard bombs and gunfire. The ISIS flag was raised in our hospital,” Dr. Sainuddon Moti said. When asked how many patients were inside the hospital, he could not give a figure. “But they are okay, they are okay,” assured Atar. The movement of the armed group within the city caused traffic congestion, said Drieza Lininding on Facebook. “The Marawi City jail is also under siege. Oh my Allah, spare my family and relatives from any harm,” Lininding added. Maulana Macadato, who was inside his residence during the siege, was able to take hold of an ISIS flag carried by the group. He said it would appear that the attackers were controlling the traffic. “Meanwhile, as conflict escalates, we also have power interruption,” said Javier Alonto, another resident. Some teachers were able to get out of MSU and flee to Iligan City, about 40 kilometers away from Marawi. Calls for peaceful resolution Several Maranaos living in Marawi and other areas posted #savemarawi and #prayforMarawi on social media to call attention to the situation. Mino Macalandap, a residenti, posted: “It may have gone beyond man’s control. I can only offer my prayers for my Ranao.” Akram Latip, a native of Lanao Sur, opined: “The best solution for Marawi City now is for the AFP to disengage the ISIS Group. If they push through with the military operation the city will be left with total destruction. Let the Local Executives, Ulama, Elders and other influential people talk with the ISIS Group and allow them to leave in peace. That’s the best way to protect the civilians and avoid more casualties and destruction.” “Please keep the civilians safe in Marawi City. I call on the government to help the civilians evacuate the area safely. Many of the students are trapped in their schools, among them are my relatives. I pray to Allah swt to please keep them safe from harm,” said Maisara Damdamun, a commissioner of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission. “As the city becomes a battleground between armed groups and government forces, the Iligan-Marawi highway has been closed, prompting fears of a food shortage. I fear for the women and children who might be caught in the crossfire. And I pray for the safety and protection of MSU students, faculty, administration officials and staff and their families, and other residents there. May this disturbance be a short one,” said James Mante, an alumnus of MSU. Others posted tips on how to keep themselves safe. “Let us all pray for the fast resolution of the crisis,” Marawi-based lawyer Adom Macarambon pleaded. Fear and anger ARMM Governor Mujiv Hataman called for an emergency meeting and activated a technical management group monitoring developments in Marawi. In a statement Tuesday, Hataman said “the regional government of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao has been receiving reports of firefighting across Marawi City between an unidentified group of armed men and government security forces. “Words might seem useless right now, as no words can express what we feel as we share in the fear and anger of our people. We strongly condemn these acts of terror committed against the people of Marawi City and swear to take immediate action as necessary. “Marawi City is known as the Philippines’ Islamic City, but it is home to people of different histories, different beliefs. That these acts of terror are happening in a diverse community bound by mutual respect and a shared commitment to peace is a travesty. “Any group who sows terror and then dares to say that they do it in the name of Islam should be ashamed. Any man who claims to fight for a just cause, yet dares to incite violence a few days before the Holy Month of Ramadhan is a monster whose words belie his actions. “The regional government stands in solidarity with the city of Marawi in these dark times. We have won many struggles together and we will stop at nothing to bring these terrorists to justice and win back the peace in your beloved city and in the Bangsamoro.” ‘Contained’ In a statement Tuesday, the Armed Forces’ Western Mindanao Command identified the attackers as members of the Maute group. “At 5pm, government forces were able to contain majority of the militants in one area, however, some of their sympathizers conducted diversionary tactics in other locations to divide the attention of the reinforcing AFP personnel. “Operations are still ongoing and other details cannot yet be revealed so as not to compromise operational security.” Wesmincom urged people not to post on social media “information that would tend to exacerbate the situation. Especially photos and videos on the movements of our troops and on terrorist propaganda circulating through social media.” “We will provide pertinent updates as soon as advisable,” it added. The Maute group, which has claimed to embrace the ISIS cause, has been the target of military and police operations in recent months in Butig and Piagapo towns in Lanao del Sur.

      " An ISIS flag is seen displayed at an apartment in Marawi City where a fierce gun battle between government security forces and ISIS-linked groups is raging. MANILA: Five government troops were injured as police and military clashed with members of the Maute and terrorist groups in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur on Tuesday. The clashes happened in Brgy. Basak Malulut around 2 p.m. and is still ongoing as of posting time, said Lt. Col. Jo-Ar Herrera, spokesperson of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division said. The group of armed men was believed to be led by Abu Sayyaf Group leader Isnilon Hapilon, who was previously based in Basilan. The military has previously reported that Hapilon was badly hurt in one of its airstrikes early this year. A separate spot military report said that the Marawi-Iligan road is temporarily closed. The Department of National Defense earlier said that Hapilon left Basilan province to establish a province or “wilayat” of the Islamic State in Lanao del Sur. There were also circulating reports that terrorists  raised their black flag at the Amai Pakpak Medical Center and attacked the city’s police station, but Herrera said they are still validating the information. The Armed Forces of the Philippines said that the operation in Marawi was initiated by combined state forces contrary to other reports. “We received reliable info on Hapilon and a number of his cohorts. Updates to follow as the operation is still ongoing. Please do not believe propaganda from other groups,” AFP spokesperson Brig. Gen. Restituto Padilla said. A staff member from the Marawi City local government said that they have activated a city crisis committee and peace and order council to pacify the situation. Marawi City is nearby Butig town, where the Maute had previously established its presence. The Maute group is one of less than a dozen new armed Muslim groups that have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and formed a loose alliance in the southern Philippines in recent years. It has been blamed for a bomb attack that killed 15 people in southern Davao city, President Rodrigo Duterte’s hometown, last September and a number of attacks on government forces in Lanao, although it has faced setbacks from a series of military offensives. In April, troops backed by airstrikes killed dozens of Maute militants and captured their jungle camp near Lanao del Sur’s Piagapo town. Troops found homemade bombs, grenades, combat uniforms and passports of suspected Indonesian militants in the camp. Residents took to Twitter about the clashes, reporting of gunfire, raising of black flags, and air strikes. Philippines Daily Inquirer/Asia News Network \n",

Usman added one member was saying \"'Yung mga pulis diyan na matatapang, magsilabasan kayo.\" [Translation:All the brave policemen out there, come out here (and fight).] Meanwhile, Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao Regional Governor Mujiv Hataman expressed the \"fear and anger\" of residents. \"We strongly condemn these acts of terror committed against the people of Marawi City and swear to take immediate action as necessary,\" he said. \n",

      "Fierce clashes erupted yesterday afternoon between government forces and members of the Maute terror group, with the military conducting air strikes.The combat operation was launched following reports that Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, along with the core members of the Maute group, was sighted in the area allegedly out to conduct terror attack. Lt. Col. Jo-ar Herrera, spokesman of the Army’s 1st Infantry Division (ID), said that the operation was launched after reports from the local community in Marawi City about the presence of the terrorists in the area.Herrera said that the military started the operation at around 2 p.m. But as of press time yesterday there were still no result. The operation was launched in a residential area in Barangay Pasak, Marawi City.  “We launched surgical operation to neutralize the group which is planning to sow terrorism in Marawi City,” said Herrera.“Initially, we saw about 15 armed men…based on the report, allegedly including Isnilon Hapilon…so we are conducting operation against high value target,” he added.The military has been tracking down Hapilon in Lanao areas since January following reports that he was seriously wounded during air strike in Butig town.Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief of Staff Gen. Eduardo Ano described Hapilon then as being carried by his men on a makeshift stretcher and needed blood transfusion to survive.A leader of the Abu Sayyaf group operating in Basilan, Hapilon is the acknowledged emir or leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in Southeast Asia.He transferred to Central Mindanao, particularly in Lanao del Sur last December supposedly to establish ISIS caliphate there.Thousands flee combat zoneThe fighting reportedly sent thousands of residents fleeing while others were locked inside their homes. It happened about two days before the start of the fasting month of Ramadhan.Marawi City is part of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao.Police said the fighting erupted in the villages of Caloocan and Basak Malutlut, near the Lanao del Sur police provincial command and Mindanao State University.In a phone interview, Senior Supt. Oscar Nantes, Lanao del Sur police provincial director, said the clashes erupted between the Maute group and government forces at about 3 p.m. when a military-backed police team was to serve search warrants against members of the terror group.Fighting erupted when the Maute group opened fire on personnel from the military’s 103rd Brigade, he said.Chief Supt. Reuben Sindac, PNP-ARMM regional director based here, said all police units across Lanao del Sur have been placed on heightened alert against the possible spillover of the fighting.Armored personnel carriers backed the ground troops in fighting the still undetermined number of Maute Group members, Nantes said.As of 4 p.m., two Air Force planes dropped several bombs in selected areas of Marawi City, particularly in the border with Lanao del Sur beside Lake Lanao.Sporadic gun shots could still be heard in the heart of Marawi City, according to Zia Alonto Adiong, an ARMM lawmaker and a resident of Marawi City. He appealed for residents to stay home.The clashes erupted while Muslims are preparing to start the fasting month, which is expected to begin this Friday with the possible sighting of the moon on Thursday night.

      " Posted at May 23 2017 10:12 PM | Updated as of May 24 2017 03:32 AM Share MARAWI CITY - Government troops and police battled dozens of gunmen protecting one of the world's most wanted Islamic militants in a built-up area of a southern city on Tuesday, authorities said. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said one policeman and two soldiers were killed in the clashes, which began when security forces raided a house where they believed Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the infamous Abu Sayyaf kidnap gang and Philippine head of Islamic State, was hiding. The fighting took place in Marawi, a mostly Muslim-populated city of about 200,000 people on the southern island of Mindanao, with the gunmen attacking a hospital during the clashes, Ano told CNN Philippines. \"Please advise people to stay inside their houses. We will clear the area,\" said Philippine military chief of staff General Eduardo Ano. He said the fighting began when police and troops raided a house on Tuesday afternoon where Hapilon, the subject of a US State Department bounty of $5 million, was believed to be hiding. This triggered fierce clashes throughout the afternoon and into the evening, with Ano estimating there were about 50 gunmen. Photos posted on social media by Marawi residents showed the gunmen walking through the streets of Basak, a Marawi suburb of about 1,700 people. A woman who asked not to be named told AFP by text that she saw about 10 armed men take up positions at the gate of a government hospital. Police clashed with the gunmen near the hospital, leaving one officer seriously wounded and one of the extremists dead, she added. The military said it could not confirm the militant's death. Ano said eight security personnel had been injured in the clashes. - Deadly history - The Abu Sayyaf, based on the most southern islands of Mindanao, has kidnapped hundreds of Filipinos and foreigners since the early 1990s to extract ransoms.  The militants beheaded an elderly German early this year and two Canadians last year after ransom demands were not met. It has also been blamed for the country's worst terrorist attacks, including the 2004 bombing of a ferry in Manila Bay that claimed more than 100 lives. The US State Department bounty for Hapilon was offered following alleged terrorist acts against US citizens, including the 2001 kidnapping of three Americans in the western Philippines -- two of whom were later killed. Security analysts say Hapilon has been trying to unite Filipino militant groups that have professed allegiance to IS. These include the Maute group, which is based near Marawi, hundreds of kilometers to the north of the Abu Sayyaf strongholds. The Maute group has engaged in repeated deadly battles with the military over the past year in rural areas around Marawi. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has an office near Marawi and operates in the area, voiced alarm that civilians may get caught up in the fighting. \"We are extremely concerned about the impact of the ongoing hostilities in Marawi City on the civilians,\" the head of the ICRC's Philippine delegation, Pascal Porchet, said in a statement. \"We urge all parties to the conflict to spare civilians and respect civilian property, such as hospitals and schools, in fulfullment of their obligations to respect international humanitarian law.\" The Marawi fighting came six weeks after the military foiled a mass kidnapping attempt by the Abu Sayyaf on the central resort island of Bohol. The US and other Western governments warned this month that terrorists plan to kidnap foreigners in tourist hotspots across the central and western Philippines. str-cgm/kma/sm © Agence France-Presse Share BBC names first female Doctor Who July 17, 2017 WATCH: Nadine, James draw shrieks as they open The Eddys July 17, 2017 WATCH: First teaser trailer for Disney's 'A Wrinkle in Time' July 17, 2017 WATCH: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' behind the scenes footage July 17, 2017 Alyssa delights in reunion with former Ateneo teammates July 17, 2017 Defense chief submits martial law recommendation to Duterte July 17, 2017 Why boyfriend didn't like KZ's song for him July 17, 2017 F1: Four in a row for Hamilton as blowout hits Vettel July 17, 2017 Blu Girls take down Canada anew in softball tilt July 17, 2017 'The Voice Teens': Emarjhun stuns, leads Team Bamboo's charge July 17, 2017 'The Voice Teens': Team Sarah's Nisha, Jona keep dream alive July 17, 2017 Marvel stuns fans with giant Avengers gathering July 17, 2017 PVL: Air Force outlast Bali Pure for 2nd straight win July 16, 2017 This time, La Salle's Maraño exits MOA Arena with a smile July 16, 2017 PVL: HD Spikers ascend to share of first July 16, 2017 WATCH: Jessy, Bela, Kim sizzle in 'Despacito' number    Removed from 'Banana Sundae'?

      "May 23 (UPI) -- President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines on Tuesday declared a partial state of martial law in the Pacific island nation after two soldiers and a police officer were killed in clashes with terror insurgents. Duterte made the declaration for the island of Mindanao, in the nation's south. Troops and police officers were engaged in fights with pro-Islamic State Maute insurgents on Tuesday in Marawi City, the Philippine army said. The scene of the firefight was near police headquarters and the campus of Mindanao State University, officials said. The clash was initiated by the army, who saw Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon in the vicinity, with about 15 followers, Philippine Army spokesman Col. Jo-ar Herara said. By Tuesday night, the city of Marawi was under complete lockdown. Maute is a radical Islamist group based in Lanao del Sur which, with Abu Sayyaf, has conducted terrorist attacks in the Philippines for several years. Both are aligned with the Islamic State, also identified as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh. At least 50 Maute members have been killed in isolated clashes with Philippine police and soldiers in the past five months. The total number of casualties in Tuesday's fight was not immediately known. Earlier Tuesday, members of the Philippine army searched Marawi City for Hapilon and his party when the gunfire began. Armored vehicles were brought in, neighborhoods were locked down and two aircraft of the Philippine air force dropped bombs on selected targets. The incidents in Marawi City, whose population of about 200,000 is largely Muslim, came two days before the start of the fasting month of Ramadan.

      " Army soldiers close in on the Islamist terrorists in Marawi City The black flag of the so-called Islamic State (IS) was raised in a Philippine city as government troops clashed with terrorists today (Tuesday, May 23). One soldier has been confirmed killed, and at least eight are believed to have been wounded in clashes with the Maute terror group — believed to be harbouring a notorious Abu Sayyaf leader — in Marawi City, Lanao Del Sur. Military spokesman Brigadier General Restituto Padilla said Abu Sayyaf sub-leader Isnilon Hapilon — who has an FBI bounty of $5 million on his head — was identified among an estimated 15 militants. Hapilon is the official representative, or ‘emir’, of IS in the region. Last month we reported that his was believed critically injured in a clash with government forces. The fighting erupted at 2pm in the villages of Caloocan and Basak Malutlut. Local reports say the terrorists had earlier entered a hospital and hoisted the black flag of IS. A militant attaches a black flag of IS to an ambulance outside the hospital After the bullets began to fly, thousands of residents fled or locked themselves inside their homes. The troops were supported by armoured personnel carriers and as of 4pm two Air Force planes had dropped several bombs on identified targets. “I’m appealing to residents of Marawi City to stay home, drop on the ground if they hear gunshots,” Mamintal Adiong Jr, the provincial governor said, “They have to lock their doors and gates too.” The Maute Islamist group — also known as the Dawlah Islamiya Philippines — is comprised of former Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas and some foreign fighters. They are thought to have taken their name from its founder Abdullah Maute and claim affiliation to IS. The clashes come as Muslims preparing to start the fasting month of Ramadan, which could start on Friday or Saturday, depending on the sighting of the moon. Operations against the militants are continuing. \n",
